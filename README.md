# Analyze EV Charging Behavior

This project aims to analyze and predict electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior and energy consumption. We will analyze charging patterns, user profiles, and vehicle characteristics to try and  develop models to predict future charging needs and optimize charging station usage. 

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns/data

## Setup Instructions


### Running the Notebook

Open and execute the `Final_Project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook cell by cell. Ensure you downloaded the dataset and it is inside the same folder as your .ipynb. Make sure the csv file is called the same thing as what the code is reading with the line: df = pd.read_csv('ev_charging_patterns.csv')
